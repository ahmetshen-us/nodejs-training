Testing with mocha and Chai
// Mocha gives us a Suite for describing, running and
//  building tests but it does not give us a way to
//   check values. That is where you might want to consider using
// 	Chai. I'm going to go ahead and install Chai locally to this project and
// 	I'm going ahead and send it a save-dev flag. And the reason that
// 	I'm going to save Chai to the Dev dependencies, is because Chai is going to
// 	 be needed to test our application. Our Dev dependencies are where we save the
// 	 things that we need to work with an application where our
// main dependencies, save those packages that we need for the application to actually run.
